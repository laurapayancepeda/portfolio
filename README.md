# About me 
Hi! I’m Laura Payan Cepeda. My journey started in business, where I quickly fell in love with strategy. Over time, I realized that data is what truly drives smart decisions. Now, I help businesses and their teams solve challenges and reach their goals by making data work for them. Data holds the key to performance, but only when it’s understood and used the right way. I’m driven by curiosity, ambition and a passion for using data to create real, meaningful results.

 ### Sentiment Analysis and Pattern Recognition in Personal Journals for Emotional Insight and Well-being Monitoring
- Developed a sentiment analysis and clustering model to analyze personal journal entries, uncovering themes and emotional patterns affecting well-being.By analyzing past journal data, the model can predict emotional trends, identify triggers, and provide personalized well-being recommendations. 
K-means clustering was utilized to categorize journal entries into three distinct sentiment groups:
1. Slightly Positive – Predominantly associated with family-related emotions.
2. Negative – Largely linked to work-related stress.
3. Very Positive – Characterized by themes of family and enjoyment.
- Additionally, the Apriori algorithm was employed to identify associations between words and recurring themes within each sentiment cluster, facilitating the recognition of emotional triggers and behavioral patterns.
