# About me 
Hi! I’m Laura Payan Cepeda. My journey started in business, where I quickly fell in love with strategy. Over time, I realized that data is what truly drives smart decisions. Now, I help businesses and their teams solve challenges and reach their goals by making data work for them. Data holds the key to performance, but only when it’s understood and used the right way. I’m driven by curiosity, ambition and a passion for using data to create real, meaningful results.

# Projects 

*I document my journey, taking on a variety of projects across different industries, driven by my natural curiosity about applying my skills and expanding my knowledge*

## Analytics and Business Intelligence

### Business Intelligence to support real-life decision-making and core functions in an SME (Power BI)
As a part of my masters dissertation, I developed a BI dashboard using power BI from Odoo ERP data. I designed and developed seven functional navigation tabs for core business functions of sales, inventory, inventory and customer relationship management. The company's requirement for this dashbaord was to streamline data management, enhance operational efficiency and improve decision-making by data-driven insights. 

### Business intelligence for football match analysis (Tableau)
This Tableau dashboard analyzes Liverpool's performance in the 2019 Champions League Final (Statsbomb data), focusing on key metrics such as pass maps, shot locations, passing success rates, and player positioning. It provides insights into the team’s passing efficiency, attacking strategies, and overall performance, offering a comprehensive view of the match. I am currently still working on this dashboard, hoping to bring more metrics and KPIs.

### Player and Team Performance of the UEFA EURO 2024 season Statsbombdata (RStudio and Power BI)
- Ranks teams based on the number of shots taken to compare shooting volume.
- Highlights the attacking contributions of the top 20 players (min. 360 minutes played) using shots and key passes per 90 minutes.
- Visualizes player completed passes into the final third (filtering here to Toni Kroos), showcasing his role in ball progression.
- I used the data from statsbomb, and and made a Power BI dashboard from these insights. I am currently still working in expanding this dashboard with more useful metrics and KPIs

### Dashboard detailing customer (Excel) 

## Predictive Analytics 

### Designing a car purchase customer acceptance model (decision tree)
Developed a decision tree model to classify customer acceptance of car purchases based on key variables such as price, maintenance cost, safety ratings, and seating capacity.
-Achieved 95% accuracy with a 10% classification error, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

### Wine Quality Prediction 
Applied a CART-based classification model to predict wine quality using 12 key features.
-Model evaluation using a confusion matrix showed an overall accuracy of 55.07%, with areas for improvement in sensitivity and precision.

### Using business intelligence for environmental monitoring and forecasting 
- Tableau Dashboard: Visualized Lake Powell fisheries data (2004-2018) to monitor environmental patterns, fish population trends, and ecosystem health.
- Predictive Model (Random Forest): Implemented in RapidMiner to forecast fish weight based on Striped Bass stomach contents. Achieved 56.91% accuracy, with 94.77% precision for lighter fish and 99.19% recall for heavier fish, aiding fisheries management and ecological research.

 ### Sentiment Analysis and Pattern Recognition in Personal Journals for Emotional Insight and Well-being Monitoring
- Developed a sentiment analysis and clustering model to analyze personal journal entries, uncovering themes and emotional patterns affecting well-being.By analyzing past journal data, the model can predict emotional trends, identify triggers, and provide personalized well-being recommendations. 
K-means clustering was utilized to categorize journal entries into three distinct sentiment groups:
1. Slightly Positive – Predominantly associated with family-related emotions.
2. Negative – Largely linked to work-related stress.
3. Very Positive – Characterized by themes of family and enjoyment.
- Additionally, the Apriori algorithm was employed to identify associations between words and recurring themes within each sentiment cluster, facilitating the recognition of emotional triggers and behavioral patterns.
