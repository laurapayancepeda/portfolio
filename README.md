## About me 
Hi, I’m Laura Payan Cepeda. My journey started in business, where I quickly fell in love with strategy. Over time, I realized that data is what truly drives smart decisions. Now, I help businesses and their teams solve challenges and reach their goals by making data work for them. Data holds the key to performance, but only when it’s understood and used the right way. I’m driven by curiosity, ambition and a passion for using data to create real, meaningful results. 

*I welcome opportunities for collaboration and partnership. If you are seeking someone to analyze your data and provide insights, please feel free to reach out*
